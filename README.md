## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bautisalva/LuCam-python-image-acquisition-software.git
cd LuCam-python-image-acquisition-software
```

### 2. Install Requirements

(Recommended to use a virtual environment.)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Dependencies include**:
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `PyQt6`

> You must also have the **Lumenera camera drivers** installed for `lucamapi.dll` to work.

### 3. Running the Application

```bash
python test.py
```

If the `lucam` module is not found (no camera connected), the app **falls back** to a simulated camera for testing.
